                    <p>I started learning web development in February 2018. Before that I studied engineering two and a half years at Estonian University of Life Sciences. Last November I realized that this isn't for me and I started learning Python. in Python i studied programming core principles. in February i started learning Web Development. I went through The Web Developer Bootcamp at Udemy, where i learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Also I was introduced to back-end technologies Node.js, Express and MongoDB. This portfolio website is my first larger web app, what I have made on my own. During Udemy course I made one bigger bigger app called YelpCamp.</p>
